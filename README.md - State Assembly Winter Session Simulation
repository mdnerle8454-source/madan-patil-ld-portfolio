#🏛️ State Assembly Winter Session Simulation
#📌 Overview

The State Assembly Winter Session Simulation was an experiential learning intervention designed for BCA and MCA students to simulate the functioning of a State Legislative Assembly.

The activity replicated parliamentary structure including Question Hour, Bill Presentation, Debate, and Voting procedures to create a realistic policy discussion environment.

This initiative focused on competency development through structured debate, time-bound communication, and role accountability.

#🎯 Objectives

Develop structured communication skills

Enhance policy analysis and critical thinking

Improve time-bound decision making

Encourage leadership and collaboration

Build confidence in formal discussion environments

##🧩 Simulation Design
Phase 1 – Role Allocation & Orientation

Participants were assigned roles:

Speaker

Ruling Party Members

Opposition Members

Ministers

Media Panel

Clear rules, time limits, and evaluation parameters were defined.

Phase 2 – Policy Preparation

Teams researched assigned topics and prepared:

Opening arguments

Supporting data points

Counter arguments

Policy recommendations

Preparation time was intentionally restricted to simulate real-session pressure.

Phase 3 – Live Assembly Simulation

The structured session included:

Question Hour

Bill Introduction

Debate & Rebuttal

Points of Order

Final Voting

Strict time monitoring was implemented to evaluate discipline and efficiency.

Phase 4 – Debrief & Reflection

A structured feedback session was conducted to analyze:

Argument clarity

Time utilization efficiency

Leadership presence

Emotional control

Evidence-based persuasion
